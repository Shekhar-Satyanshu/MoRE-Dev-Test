## Installation

Download/install these right away to ensure an optimal Ionic development experience:

Git for version control.
Node.js for interacting with the Ionic ecosystem. Download the LTS version here.
A code editor for... writing code! We are fans of Visual Studio Code.
Command-line terminal (CLI): FYI Windows users, for the best Ionic experience, we recommend the built-in command line (cmd) or the Powershell CLI, running in Administrator mode. For Mac/Linux users, virtually any terminal will work.
